# Baseball-Statistics Using Matlab
This project from coursera focuses on baseball analytics using the MATLAB tool. The project uses the Lahman database which is the official MLB player statistics.
In this project, we analyze historic batting statistics to answer the question: When do great hitters peak in their career?
The dataset contains pitching, batting, and defensive statistics dating back to 1871, enabling you to explore and answer a wide variety of questions.
You will compute statistics like On-base Plus Slugging (OPS), visualize results, and filter data to highlight players that meet criteria you specify, such as the number of home runs.

This project focuses on:
- Combining data from multiple tables
- Calculating statistics on groups of data
- Visualizing data
- Filtering a table to include data meeting specified criteria
- Importing data

The greatCareer.mat file contains the player career statistics which you can analyse to find out your favourite player's best season and their stats for that season.
